Each user will have a unique login access for the device and will be able to access only assigned applications and device settings. Each profile will be governed by pre-defined admin settings policies for easier management.\n\nExample: An educational institution can assign a single device to multiple students from different classes, and require access to the device at different points of time during the day. To do so, separate profiles can be created on the device with access to separate applications and study material, governed by respective admin settings. A Grade 7 student would have access to a certain set of subject material and content while the same device would offer access to different apps and notes to a Grade 10 student.\n\n\n\nThe multi-user profile feature integrates seamlessly with\u00a0Enterprise LDAP servers. IT admin can use their existing employee directory and hierarchy in Enterprise LDAP servers and assign desired\u00a0SureLock Kiosk Lockdown\u00a0profile to LDAP users or group of users. On device side, user login is authenticated from LDAP server and on successful login, pre-assigned kiosk profile is loaded.\nMulti User Mode vs Multi User Profile Setting\nSureLock\u2019s\u00a0Multi User Profile\u00a0setting is not to be confused with the\u00a0Multi User Mode\u00a0initially offered by SureLock. While Multi User Mode also allowed creation of unique users accounts on a single device, it was limited to only defining applications per user. But Multi User Profile Setting is more advanced and can even\u00a0define admin settings\u00a0for every profile.\nSteps to Enable Multi User Profile Settings in SureLock\n\nNote: Multi user profile setting will be disabled if Multi user mode is enabled.\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to\u00a0SureLock Admin Settings\u00a0and tap on\u00a0Multi-User Profile Settings.\n2. Enable\u00a0Multi-User Profile.\nProfile Management\nMultiple profiles can be added with different set of applications and configurations from\u00a0Profile Management\u00a0screen. Admin can switch between different profiles from the profile management screen by tapping on\u00a0Activate\u00a0option. Also, the admin can add, edit, clone or remove the profiles from Profile Management.\n\nExample: Profile1\u00a0and\u00a0Profile2\u00a0are created with different set of applications and settings. When\u00a0Profile1\u00a0is activated, settings of\u00a0Profile1\u00a0gets applied to the device.\n\n\nUser Management\n\nNote: User configuration is required when number of users are less and fixed).\n\n\n\nThe admin can add multiple users and associate the same/different profile for each user from User Management. Users can be added, modified, and deleted from User Management.\nOnce users are added to User Management, login screen will be displayed on SureLock Home screen. When a user logs in with the valid user credentials, the specified profile gets applied to the device.\n\nExample: 1. Create\u00a0User1,\u00a0User2\u00a0from\u00a0User Management.\n2. Associate\u00a0Profile1\u00a0for\u00a0User1\u00a0and\u00a0Profile2\u00a0for\u00a0User2.\n3. When\u00a0User1\u00a0logs in,\u00a0Profile1\u00a0gets applied to the device, whereas when\u00a0User2\u00a0logs in,\u00a0Profile2\u00a0gets applied to the device.\n\n\n\nSteps to assign profile to a user\n1. Navigate to\u00a0User Management.\n2. Long press on the desired user and tap\u00a0Edit User.\n3. Select the profile from the dropdown menu and click on\u00a0Save.\nServer Configuration\n\nNote: Server configuration is required when users are more and dynamic).\n\n\n\nAdmin can configure LDAP\u00a0server details\u00a0from the Server Configuration screen. Enter Server Path, Port, Distinguished Name, and Profile Meta Data Tag and validate the details. Once the setup is done, all the users can login to SureLock and corresponding profile gets applied to the device.\n\nExample: \nServer Path: xxx.xxx.x.x\nPort: 389\nDistinguished Name: cn=,ou=People,dc=42gears,dc=com\nProfile Meta Data Tag: description\n\n\n\n\nNote: Admin should create profiles with Meta data value in Profile Management Screen. So if any user login with his credentials, the desired profile will be applied to the device.\n\n\n\nTo create\u00a0Profile\u00a0for\u00a0User A\u00a0in\u00a0LDAP Server\n1. Add\u00a0Profile Meta Data tag\u00a0as\u00a0description\u00a0for\u00a0User A\u00a0in LDAP Server.\n2. Enter\u00a0Meta Data tag\u00a0value as\u00a0Profile1\u00a0for User A. \u00a0\n3. Create a profile with name\u00a0Profile1\u00a0in\u00a0Profile Management\u00a0in\u00a0SureLock.\n4. When\u00a0User A\u00a0logs in,\u00a0Profile1\u00a0gets applied to the device.\n\nNote: Admin can also use existing meta data tags for profile management like\u00a0givenName,\u00a0gidNumber,\u00a0cn, sn,\u00a0Email.\n\n\n\nRevoke Access when no Profile/Meta Tag is found\nEnable\u2013 If\u00a0Meta Tag\u00a0is not available for the user, it will not allow user to login.\nDisable\u2013 If\u00a0Meta Tag\u00a0is not available for the user, it will apply the default profile to the device.\nSteps to add profile meta tag for each user in LDAP\n1. Login to\u00a0LDAP Server.\n2. Select the\u00a0User\u00a0from left pane.\n3. Click on\u00a0Add new attribute.\n4. Select attribute from\u00a0Add attribute\u00a0list.\n5. Enter attribute value.\n6. Click on\u00a0Update Object.\n7. Click on\u00a0Update Object\u00a0on confirmation page.\n8. Repeat the above procedure for all the users.\nSteps to Logout from a specific user\n\u00a01. On the SureLock Home screen login into the specific user.\n\u00a02. On the SureLock Home screen of the user, tap\u00a0Back\u00a0button.\n\u00a03. Prompt is displayed to logout, click on\u00a0Log out.\n\u00a04.

          "Expanding mobile adoption across industry verticals is driving enterprises to invest huge amounts in purchasing mobile hardware. 42Gears now offers a\u00a0Multi User Profile Settings\u00a0on\u00a0SureLock Kiosk Lockdown\u00a0tool that allows multiple user profiles to be created on a single device, allowing it to be used by multiple users.\nThis feature aims to help companies reduce their mobile hardware costs by allowing different users to access the same device at different appointed times. Each user will have a unique login access for the device and will be able to access only assigned applications and device settings. Each profile will be governed by pre-defined admin settings policies for easier management.\n\nExample: An educational institution can assign a single device to multiple students from different classes, and require access to the device at different points of time during the day. To do so, separate profiles can be created on the device with access to separate applications and study material, governed by respective admin settings. A Grade 7 student would have access to a certain set of subject material and content while the same device would offer access to different apps and notes to a Grade 10 student.\n\n\n\nThe multi-user profile feature integrates seamlessly with\u00a0Enterprise LDAP servers. IT admin can use their existing employee directory and hierarchy in Enterprise LDAP servers and assign desired\u00a0SureLock Kiosk Lockdown\u00a0profile to LDAP users or group of users. On device side, user login is authenticated from LDAP server and on successful login, pre-assigned kiosk profile is loaded.\nMulti User Mode vs Multi User Profile Setting\nSureLock\u2019s\u00a0Multi User Profile\u00a0setting is not to be confused with the\u00a0Multi User Mode\u00a0initially offered by SureLock. While Multi User Mode also allowed creation of unique users accounts on a single device, it was limited to only defining applications per user. But Multi User Profile Setting is more advanced and can even\u00a0define admin settings\u00a0for every profile.\nSteps to Enable Multi User Profile Settings in SureLock\n\nNote: Multi user profile setting will be disabled if Multi user mode is enabled.\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to\u00a0SureLock Admin Settings\u00a0and tap on\u00a0Multi-User Profile Settings.\n2. Enable\u00a0Multi-User Profile.\nProfile Management\nMultiple profiles can be added with different set of applications and configurations from\u00a0Profile Management\u00a0screen. Admin can switch between different profiles from the profile management screen by tapping on\u00a0Activate\u00a0option. Also, the admin can add, edit, clone or remove the profiles from Profile Management.\n\nExample: Profile1\u00a0and\u00a0Profile2\u00a0are created with different set of applications and settings. When\u00a0Profile1\u00a0is activated, settings of\u00a0Profile1\u00a0gets applied to the device.\n\n\nUser Management\n\nNote: User configuration is required when number of users are less and fixed).\n\n\n\nThe admin can add multiple users and associate the same/different profile for each user from User Management. Users can be added, modified, and deleted from User Management.\nOnce users are added to User Management, login screen will be displayed on SureLock Home screen. When a user logs in with the valid user credentials, the specified profile gets applied to the device.\n\nExample: 1. Create\u00a0User1,\u00a0User2\u00a0from\u00a0User Management.\n2. Associate\u00a0Profile1\u00a0for\u00a0User1\u00a0and\u00a0Profile2\u00a0for\u00a0User2.\n3. When\u00a0User1\u00a0logs in,\u00a0Profile1\u00a0gets applied to the device, whereas when\u00a0User2\u00a0logs in,\u00a0Profile2\u00a0gets applied to the device.\n\n\n\nSteps to assign profile to a user\n1. Navigate to\u00a0User Management.\n2. Long press on the desired user and tap\u00a0Edit User.\n3. Select the profile from the dropdown menu and click on\u00a0Save.\nServer Configuration\n\nNote: Server configuration is required when users are more and dynamic).\n\n\n\nAdmin can configure LDAP\u00a0server details\u00a0from the Server Configuration screen. Enter Server Path, Port, Distinguished Name, and Profile Meta Data Tag and validate the details. Once the setup is done, all the users can login to SureLock and corresponding profile gets applied to the device.\n\nExample: \nServer Path: xxx.xxx.x.x\nPort: 389\nDistinguished Name: cn=,ou=People,dc=42gears,dc=com\nProfile Meta Data Tag: description\n\n\n\n\nNote: Admin should create profiles with Meta data value in Profile Management Screen. So if any user login with his credentials, the desired profile will be applied to the device.\n\n\n\nTo create\u00a0Profile\u00a0for\u00a0User A\u00a0in\u00a0LDAP Server\n1.

It can be used to lock down iPads in classrooms so students do not get distracted while studying.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this knowledge article is to provide a guide on installing and configuring Apple\u2019s Classroom App to lock down iPads in classrooms.\nPrerequisites\niOS 10.3.2 or later.iPadOS 13 or later.4th-generation iPads or later.iPad Mini 2 or later.All iPads must be Bluetooth-enabled.All iPads must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.Student devices must be supervised.\nSteps\nStep 1: To install and configure Classroom app\n1. Install the Classroom App\nInstall the free Apple Classroom app on the teacher\u2019s iPad.\nNote: Student devices do not need to have the app installed.\n2. Create and name the class.\nLaunch the app, tap Create new class, and give your class a name. You can create multiple classes.\n3. Check Bluetooth and Wi-Fi settings.\nMake sure that all iPads are Bluetooth-enabled and connected to the same Wi-Fi network.\n4. Add students.\nTap on the class(es) you created, and then tap Add Students.\n5. Prepare student devices to join\nAsk your students to open the Settings app and look for the Classroom menu option.\n6. Ask students to select the class name.\nOnce students have selected the classroom menu, tell them to look for the name of your class.\n7. Share the code with students.\nOnce students have selected the name of your class, give them the 4-digit code that is displayed on the teacher device.\n8. Watch student names appear on-screen.\nAfter this, students will be added to your class, and you will be able to see their names listed on the screen.\nWith the Classroom app installed on the teacher device, teachers can:\nOpen apps on student devices.Restrict access to certain apps on a particular device.Open websites on student devices.Lock all student iPads (\u201cEyes on teacher mode\u201d).Mute all student iPads.Get a live preview of all student screens at once, and tap on any student device to view it as a full screen.Create student groups for projects.\nShared iPads\nIf students are sharing iPads, teachers can assign multiple students unique login credentials to access the same device. Students can just tap on the image on the iPad screen, enter their login credentials, and access the device to see their assignments and homework. In this case, the iPad will be the same, but the apps might be different depending on the specific needs of students and as assigned by the teacher.\nStep 2: To configure the classroom app through an MDM solution\nYou can manually set up devices using the Classroom app, as described above, but a more efficient method is to use a mobile device management (MDM) solution. This lets IT admins configure iPads with class rosters, automatically completing the setup process outlined above and configuring chosen settings and restrictions.\nUsing an MDM solution, IT admins can:\nCreate teacher and student profiles.Create classes and add students on a teacher\u2019s behalf.Push apps that students are allowed to use in class.Enable teachers to fully control student devices.\nFrom the teacher\u2019s perspective, the appropriate roster and settings immediately appear once teachers open the Classroom app on their device.\nStep 3: To configure the Classroom app through an MDM solution and Apple School Manager\nUsers can set up Apple Classroom by syncing an MDM solution with Apple School Manager (ASM). ASM combines Apple\u2019s Device Enrollment Program and Volume Purchase Program (for apps and content) with the ability to create Managed Apple IDs on student-owned devices.\n1. Configure the users and classes.\nConfigure the users and classes on ASM, and set the users as teachers and students.\n2. Sync the owner.\nSyncing the owners in System Manager allows System Manager to see all users on ASM.\n3. Assigning each iPad.\nSet the owner for each iPad.\n4. Profile creation and installation.\nCreate the desired combination of settings and policies (known as an \u201ceducation profile\u201d) and install the profile on each iPad.\n5. Launching the Apple Classroom.\nLaunch the Apple Classroom app on the teacher iPad, and the teacher will be able to control and monitor the student iPads.\nNeed help?

CONTACT US\u00a0\nWas this helpful?YesNo Apple\u2019s Classroom App is a key part of Apple\u2019s toolkit for managing Apple devices in schools, alongside the Apple School Manager and Shared iPad programs. It can be used to lock down iPads in classrooms so students do not get distracted while studying. The purpose of this knowledge article is to provide a guide on installing and configuring Apple\u2019s Classroom App to lock down iPads in classrooms. Prerequisites iOS 10.3.2 or later. iPadOS 13 or later. 4th-generation iPads or later. iPad Mini 2 or later. All iPads must be Bluetooth-enabled. All iPads must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Student devices must be supervised. Step 1: To install and configure Classroom app 1. Install the Classroom App Install the free Apple Classroom app on the teacher\u2019s iPad. Note: Student devices do not need to have the app installed. 2. Create and name the class. Launch the app, tap Create new class, and give your class a name. You can create multiple classes. 3. Check Bluetooth and Wi-Fi settings. Make sure that all iPads are Bluetooth-enabled and connected to the same Wi-Fi network. 4. Add students. Tap on the class(es) you created, and then tap Add Students. 5. Prepare student devices to join Ask your students to open the Settings app and look for the Classroom menu option. 6. Ask students to select the class name. Once students have selected the classroom menu, tell them to look for the name of your class. 7. Share the code with students. Once students have selected the name of your class, give them the 4-digit code that is displayed on the teacher device. 8. Watch student names appear on-screen. After this, students will be added to your class, and you will be able to see their names listed on the screen. With the Classroom app installed on the teacher device, teachers can: Open apps on student devices. Restrict access to certain apps on a particular device. Open websites on student devices. Lock all student iPads (\u201cEyes on teacher mode\u201d). Mute all student iPads. Get a live preview of all student screens at once, and tap on any student device to view it as a full screen. Create student groups for projects. Shared iPads If students are sharing iPads, teachers can assign multiple students unique login credentials to access the same device. Students can just tap on the image on the iPad screen, enter their login credentials, and access the device to see their assignments and homework. In this case, the iPad will be the same, but the apps might be different depending on the specific needs of students and as assigned by the teacher. Step 2: To configure the classroom app through an MDM solution You can manually set up devices using the Classroom app, as described above, but a more efficient method is to use a mobile device management (MDM) solution. This lets IT admins configure iPads with class rosters, automatically completing the setup process outlined above and configuring chosen settings and restrictions. Using an MDM solution, IT admins can: Create teacher and student profiles. Create classes and add students on a teacher\u2019s behalf. Push apps that students are allowed to use in class. Enable teachers to fully control student devices. From the teacher\u2019s perspective, the appropriate roster and settings immediately appear once teachers open the Classroom app on their device. Step 3: To configure the Classroom app through an MDM solution and Apple School Manager Users can set up Apple Classroom by syncing an MDM solution with Apple School Manager (ASM). ASM combines Apple\u2019s Device Enrollment Program and Volume Purchase Program (for apps and content) with the ability to create Managed Apple IDs on student-owned devices. 1. Configure the users and classes. Configure the users and classes on ASM, and set the users as teachers and students. 2. Sync the owner. Syncing the owners in System Manager allows System Manager to see all users on ASM. 3. Assigning each iPad. Set the owner for each iPad. 4. Profile creation and installation. Create the desired combination of settings and policies (known as an \u201ceducation profile\u201d) and install the profile on each iPad. 5. Launching the Apple Classroom. Launch the Apple Classroom app on the teacher iPad, and the teacher will be able to control and monitor the student iPads. Need help? CONTACT US Was this helpful?YesNo Was this helpful?

AstroFarm Agent Service For macOS Host Machine AstroFarm is a private device sharing solution using which you can share, manage, and control Android devices remotely. \nLet us consider a scenario where an enterprise dealing with mobile applications, owns all necessary mobile devices to help them with development, testing, and troubleshooting phases.\u00a0However, due to certain challenges, the employees might not have physical access to the devices. This is where AstroFarm comes into the picture.  \nContributors having Host machines can add devices to AstroFarm and Users across the globe can use the device to develop or test the apps or troubleshoot the issues on the devices.

CONTACT US\u00a0\nWas this helpful?YesNo Geofencing lets administrators set a virtual boundary around places like offices or warehouses. They can then apply specific rules to devices as they come in or go out of this boundary. This simplifies device management and ensures security measures are in place. Admins can configure jobs to be deployed on the devices when the user enters or exits this geographical\u00a0 fence. Geo Fence requires GPS capability on the device. This feature will only function if the location permission is enabled on the device. For now the GeoFence job is available for Android, iOS and Windows platforms. Enable High Accuracy option for Location Tracking & Geo-Fence in the\u00a0SureMDM console under Account Settings -> Miscellaneous Settings. 1. Login to the SureMDM Console. 2. On SureMDM Home, navigate to Jobs and click on New Job. 3. On the Select Operating System screen, click Android or iOS. 4. On the Select Job Type screen, select Geo Fence. 5. On the Geo Fence prompt, select Enable Geo Fencing. 6. On the Select Fence tab, use Search option to go to a specific address 6. Click the Draw icon (located on the right of the map), place the cursor at the center of the location, and click and move the cursor until it covers the desired area. Click again to set the boundary. Once the location is marked, a prompt appears with Radius, Lat and Lng details. 7. Name the Geo Fence and click Save. 8. The newly created fence will show up under Fence Details. Entering the Fence: Select Fence Entered tab, click Add to select the job(s) that will be activated on the device when it enters the fenced area and also specify if an alert has to be sent to the Device, MDM, or Email. NOTE: \u00a0In the Select Jobs to Add screen, select the multiple jobs from the list using Ctrl key. Exiting the Fence: Select the Fence Exited tab, click Add to select the job(s) that will be activated on the device when it exits the fenced area at the specified end time, and also specify if an alert has to be sent to the Device, MDM, or Email. 9. \u00a0In the Job Details window, enter a Job Name. The newly created job will be listed in the Jobs List section. 10.. Go back to the Home tab and select the Android/iOS device(s) or group(s) and click Apply to launch the Apply Job/Profile To Device prompt. 11. In the Apply Job/Profile To Device prompt, select the job and click Apply.
